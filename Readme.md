# 📘 25 Days of Verilog – Screenshot Documentation

Welcome to my **25-day Verilog challenge**! This repository documents my RTL design learning through daily **screenshots** of Verilog code, testbenches, and simulation waveforms.

Though this repo does **not contain actual `.v` source code**, it visually showcases my progress in **digital electronics**, **RTL modeling**, and **verification concepts** using Verilog HDL.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Verilog HDL (RTL + Testbench)**
- **Simulation Tools**: ModelSim / QuestaSim / Vivado / EDA Playground
- **Waveform Visualization**: EDA Waveform Viewer

## 🖼️ What’s Inside?

Each day's folder contains **screenshots** of:

- ✅ RTL Code (Verilog)
- ✅ Testbench setup
- ✅ Output console or waveform result

📝 Use these visuals to understand how each design was structured, simulated, and debugged. These serve as visual notes for learning and revision.

---

## 📌 How to Use This Repository

1. Browse the folders by `Day-XX` naming.
2. Open `.png` or `.jpg` files to view:
   - The Verilog design
   - The testbench logic
   - Output simulation results
3. Refer for learning concepts or interview prep!

---

## 🎯 Why Screenshots?

- Acts as a quick reference for interview revision.
- Documents simulation results without needing tools.
- Great for students or beginners who want to **visualize Verilog designs**.
